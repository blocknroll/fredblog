          <p>
            I'm pretty excited about today. If the conditions are right,
            this might be the day I get to fly off the top of the hill
            for the first time. First solo!
          </p>
          <p>
            Doug and I both were ready to launch off the top yesterday
            evening. But just as we were about to go, the wind died
            down and it was a no-go. No worries. No need to rush it.
            Our time will come again.
          </p>
          <p>
            And here it is. This evening's session is starting to look good...
          </p>

          <p>
            On one hand, I'm super excited that things are lining up
            and its looking like I might get to fly. On the other hand,
            I'm bummed Doug isn't here to get some with us. Next time, Douglas!

              Beautiful night for a flight, wouldn't you say?

            I'm ready to go. Kiting feels good and the wing is easy to control.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chris walks over super casually, and gives me the nod.
            We run over the checklist, two three couple pointers,
            and check the radios.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chris smiles. <br>
            "You good?"  <br>
            "I'm good." <br>
            "Alright buddy, let's do this!" <br>
            All smiles.
          </p>
          <p>
            I turn and start toward the edge. "Looks good buddy,
            no traffic, its your time, send it."
          </p>
          <p>All smiles.</p>
