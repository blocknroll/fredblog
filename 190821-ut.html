          <p>
            After a busy summer, it was time to get back to
            Point of the Mountain.
          </p>
          <p>
            This one's going to be tough to top. My friend Doug and I
            had arrived in style. We rode 1,100 miles from Rapid City,
            SD up to Buffalo, WY...then up to Yellowstone, WY for a
            couple of nights...then down past Jackson Hole, on our
            way to Park City for the night...then wrapping up in
            Salt Lake City...where we'd top it all off with some
            paragliding. Why don't my plans always sound that good?
          </p>
          <p>
            We showed up early on the south side, coffees in hand.
            Chris arrived with all the toys and we got suited up.
            The wind was a little light at first, but great for
            kiting at the top of the hill.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, the wind picked up a bit, and then suddenly,
            it was game on. It was one launch after the other, and
            it didn't take long for it to get pretty busy out there.
            Good time for a lesson on right-of-way and etiquette.
            It was the perfect scene as Chris talked us through the
            traffic in real-time and showed us the patterns.
          </p>

          <div class="post-image">
            <img src="images/190821-SuperFly-02.jpg"
                 alt="A large group of paragliders on the south side.">

          </div>

          <p>
            Then the wind picked up just a bit more, and Chris
            made the call. The wind was getting a bit too sporty
            for us at the top, but perfect for kiting at the bottom.
            And for now, that's perfect for us. As Chris says,
            "The better you can fly it on the ground, the better
            you can fly it in the air.
          </p>
