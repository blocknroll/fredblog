          <p>
            From the first time I saw one, I knew I wanted to fly paragliders.
            And now I'm finally here, doing it. I'm at Point of the Mountain
            in Salt Lake City, Utah – its considered one of the best spots in
            the world to learn and its only 25 minutes south of the city.
            Its a beautiful day.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm super excited to meet my new instructor, the one and only
            Chris Santacroce. Santa! Chris is a legend in the paragliding
            world, and no matter how much I can write right now, I don't
            have time to tell you about all the amazingly cool things
            he's done. Amongst many other things, Chris flew in the Red
            Bull Air Force as a professional adventurer – and those
            stories alone need their own dedicated blog...
          </p>

          <p>
            There's an interesting pace to the scene. Its all very
            easy-going, as you'd expect, but when the conditions are
            right, everyone steps into a different sort of gear and
            you can feel the pace change. Time to set up the gear.
          </p>

          <p>
            Chris is already working his magic with his student, Caspar.
            This is Caspar's first flight off the top of the south side
            and this is a pretty big moment. I'm lucky to be here.
            Caspar's stories also need their own blog – he's an
            awesome dude.
          </p>

          <p>
            Time to launch. I was too new to be of any help, so I
            figured I'd stay out of the way and take some shots to
            document the big moment. Much to learn...
          </p>
